# SchoolProjects
A repository which stores all of my school projects. Maybe you can use one project for your own


``` javascript
var config = {
    modules: [
        {
            module: 'MMM-SE-Reputation',
            config: {
                authCode: "df", //Authentication code retrieved from the url above.
                userId: "8902440", //User id of the site
                updateInterval: 15 * 60 * 1000, //How many milliseconds to a new update
            	site: "stackoverflow", //can be any StackExchange site
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
